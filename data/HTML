The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html53/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">HyperText Markup Language, or HTML</a> is the standard markup language for <strong><u>documents</u> designed to be displayed in a web browser.</strong> It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
<p style="margin-top:45px;">Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
